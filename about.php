        <h3 class="text-center"><b>About M&R Services</b></h3>
        <p class="text-center">M&R Services is the leading platform for connecting individuals looking for household services with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. M&R Services instantly matches thousands of customers every week with top-rated professionals in cities all around the world. With a seamless 60-second booking process, secure payment, and backed by the M&R Happiness Guarantee, M&R Services is the easiest, most convenient way to book home services.</p>
      
<br>
      <h3 class="text-center"><b>Our Story</b></h3>
      <p>M&R Service was established in 2017 as a practical solution to an age-old problem: finding top-rated, efficient professionals for common household services. Rehnuma was a 19-year-old A-Level Student in Chittagong when she decided to find this solution after having to relocate to Dhaka. Rehnuma found it challenging to hire reliable handymen to complete household tasks while refurbishing her apartments. There was no simple solution. She met Mashrur a few years later while attending Independent University, Bangladesh in Dhaka, and learned they had similar views. They developed M&R to fill that void, with the goal of building the easiest, most convenient way for busy people everywhere to book household services.</p>
